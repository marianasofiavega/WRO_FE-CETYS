# Introduction
Arturo, our autonomous vehicle, is able to perfom remarkably thanks to a variety of diferent mechanisms that when, assembled together correctly, can help a robot accomplish a challenge such as the Future Engineers Category in the WRO Competition. So as to make clear how our robot operates, we will continue to explain how each of this mechanisms works, including which specific electronic components were used and the logic behind it´s code.
