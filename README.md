# Mechanism explanation

### `Robot¬¥s Vision (Pixy 2 Camera) üì∑`

<div style="text-align: justify;">
In order for our vehicle to detect the obstacles on the rink (red and green traffic lights and the parking walls), we decided to use the The Pixy2 Camera is a versatile vision sensor designed for robotics and automation projects. It offers powerful image recognition capabilities and is user-friendly for integrating visual processing into various applications. After you complete the settings on the camera¬¥s app, you are all set to start programming what you want your vehicle to do when detecting each signature. For example, we used the following code xis of the commands correspond to the Pixy2 Arduino library):
</div>
  
  ```ruby
pixy.ccc.getBlocks();

if (pixy.ccc.blocks[i].m_signature == 1) {            // 1 EQUALS RED BLOCK IN OUR CAMERA CONFIGURATION //
  Serial.println("Red object detected");
  followBlock_red(i, "Red");
}

else if (pixy.ccc.blocks[i].m_signature == 2) {       // 2 EQUALS GREEN BLOCK IN OUT CAMERA CONFIGURATION //
  Serial.println("Green object detected");
  followBlock_green(i, "Green");
}  
  ```
<br>

> [!NOTE]
> In this code, when the camera detects our signature number 1 (red) it activates our module "followBlock_red" which makes the robot swerve right, according to the manual rules. When it detects signature number 2 (green), it swerves left.
<br>
<br>
  
### `Front Tire Axle (HS-322HD Servo) üõû`

To enhance the vehicle's direction at every turn, we installed a free-steering system on the front axle, controlled by an HS-322HD Servo. This servo features a robust metal gear train, providing durability and reliability even under heavy load conditions. The servo operates with a 180-degree range of motion and is known for its precision and responsiveness. The HS-322HD is also equipped with a high-torque coreless motor, which enhances its performance and longevity, making it a popular choice for applications where consistent and powerful actuation is essential. The servo‚Äôs linkage connects to a custom-designed axle with a gap that allows the tires to rotate freely. Given the speed provided by the rear axle motor, the front tires do not require additional power to move forward.

The following is an example of what we explained in the previous paragraph.

  </video>
</div>

<br>

> [!NOTE]
>The servomotor shown in the video is not the same as the one we used in the end.

To use the servo in the code, it is necessary to include the "Servo.h" library. After that, all that it takes to change the servo¬¥s angle is the following command. 

```ruby
servo.write(45);
```
<br>
<br>

### `Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04) üìè`
The primary challenge in this category is navigating corners and avoiding collisions with walls. To address this, we employed the HSR04 ultrasonic sensor, which operates by emitting ultrasonic pulses and measuring the time it takes for the echoes to return after bouncing off an object. This time delay is then converted into a distance measurement, allowing the sensor to accurately detect objects and measure distances with precision. The HSR04 sensor typically has a range of 2 centimeters to 4 meters and is favored for its ease of integration with microcontrollers like Arduino due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. Its compact design and straightforward interface make it ideal for applications involving obstacle detection, proximity sensing, and distance measurement in various DIY and industrial projects. To process and interpret this signal given in centimeters, we use the following code:

```ruby
long DisCalc(int TP, int EP) {

  digitalWrite(TP, LOW);                    // CLEAR THE TRIG PIN //
  delayMicroseconds(2); 

  digitalWrite(TP, HIGH);                   // SET THE TRIG PIN HIGH FOR 10 MICROSECONDS //
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(TP, LOW);

  long duration = pulseIn(EP, HIGH);        // READ THE ECHO PIN AND CALCULATE THE DIRECTION //

  long distance = duration * 0.034 / 2;     // CALCULATE THE DISTANCE IN CENTIMETERS //

  return distance;
}
```
<br>

> [!NOTE]
>The "distance" variable represents the distance from the sensor to the wall. It‚Äôs computed by multiplying the duration of the echo by the speed of sound (0.034 cm/¬µs) and dividing by 2 to account for the round trip of the sound wave. This distance helps in determining when to navigate around obstacles.

### `Rear Tire Axle (Faulhaber MOT-165 and LEGO Differential) ‚öôÔ∏è`
The most crucial mechanism of any vehicle is its drive system, and we aimed to replicate this as closely as possible. After some trial and error during the building process, we decided to incorporate a LEGO differential kit to simulate real-world driving dynamics (you can find the kit [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4LFN1HD/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?psc=1&pd_rd_i=B0C4LFN1HD&pd_rd_w=IBBZq&content-id=amzn1.sym.386c274b-4bfe-4421-9052-a1a56db557ab&pf_rd_p=386c274b-4bfe-4421-9052-a1a56db557ab&pf_rd_r=YCBYSZ8SNM5K3903VGBB&pd_rd_wg=8Vf9g&pd_rd_r=37648874-6ee4-4abb-b28e-2df1ea089964&s=toys-and-games&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9kZXRhaWxfdGhlbWF0aWM)). In the video provided, you can see our custom differential in action, where we designed and attached additional LEGO components. For a step-by-step guide on building your own, please refer to the "Others" folder in this repository.

</div>

<br>

> [!NOTE]
>If you want to learn how a differential works you can watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4JhruinbWc) video, basically a differential gear allows wheels on the same axle to rotate at different speeds. It works by using a set of gears to distribute torque between the wheels, enabling them to turn at different rates, which is essential for smooth cornering. If ùëá is the total torque supplied by the engine to the differential, and it is divided between the two wheels, then the torque ùëá<sub>1</sub> on one wheel and ùëá<sub>2</sub> on the other wheel satisfy ùëá = ùëá<sub>1</sub> + ùëá<sub>2</sub>.
<br>
The motor used in this mechanism is a Faulhaber MOT-165. We opted for this motor because it usually operates at voltages ranging from 6V to 12V, the speed of the motor varies with voltage and load conditions, but it is designed to achieve high RPM (revolutions per minute), and it provides a modest amount of torque, suitable for small, precise applications. It is important to mention that the motor and its driver, the L298N dual H-Bridge, have their power supply, **a Li-Po battery of 1000 mAh and 7.4V**.
