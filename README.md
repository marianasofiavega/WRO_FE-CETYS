# Introduction
Arturo, our autonomous vehicle, is able to perfom remarkably thanks to a variety of diferent mechanisms that when, assembled together correctly, can help a robot accomplish a challenge such as the Future Engineers Category in the WRO Competition. So as to make clear how our robot operates, we will continue to explain how each of this mechanisms works, including which specific electronic components were used and the logic behind itÂ´s code.

### RobotÂ´s Vision (Pixy 2 Camera)
  For our vehicle to be able to detect the obstacles present on the rink (red and green traffic lights and the parking walls), we decided to use the Pixy2 Camera. Pixy2 can be programed to detect specific signatures by recognizing itÂ´s shape and or color. After you complete the settings on the cameraÂ´s app, you are all set to start programming what you want your vehicle to do when detecting each signature. For example, we used the following code:

  ```
hols hols hols
```
  
### Front Tire Axle (HS-322HD Servo)
### Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)
### Rear Tire Axle (DC Motor and LEGO Diferential)
## How it all comes together (explaining the code)
