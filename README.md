# Introduction
Arturo, our autonomous vehicle, can perform remarkably thanks to a variety of different mechanisms that when assembled correctly, can help a robot accomplish a challenge such as the Future Engineers Category in the WRO Competition. To make clear how our robot operates, we will continue to explain how each of these mechanisms works, including which specific electronic components were used and the logic behind its code.

# Mechanism explanation

### Robot¬¥s Vision (Pixy 2 Camera) üì∑
  For our vehicle to detect the obstacles on the rink (red and green traffic lights and the parking walls), we decided to use the Pixy2 Camera. Pixy2 can be programmed to detect specific signatures by recognizing it¬¥s shape and/or color. After you complete the settings on the camera¬¥s app, you are all set to start programming what you want your vehicle to do when detecting each signature. For example, we used the following code (the syntaxis of the commands correspond to the Pixy2 Arduino library):

  ```ruby
pixy.ccc.getBlocks();

if (pixy.ccc.blocks[i].m_signature == 1) {            // 1 EQUALS RED BLOCK IN OUR CAMERA CONFIGURATION //
  Serial.println("Red object detected");
  followBlock_red(i, "Red");
}

else if (pixy.ccc.blocks[i].m_signature == 2) {       // 2 EQUALS GREEN BLOCK IN OUT CAMERA CONFIGURATION //
  Serial.println("Green object detected");
  followBlock_green(i, "Green");
}  
  ```
In this code, when the camera detects our signature number 1 (red) it activates our module "followBlock_red" which makes the robot swerve right, according to the manual rules. When it detects signature number 2 (green), it swerves left.
  
### Front Tire Axle (HS-322HD Servo) üõû
With the purpose of giving the vehicle more direction at every turn, we installed a free steer system in the front tire axle controlled by an HS-322HD Servo. The servo¬¥s blades connect to an axle completely designed by us that leaves a space in between so that the tires can run freely. With the speed the motor provides in the rear axle, the front tires don¬¥t need any extra power to reel forward. 

To use the servo in the code, it is necessary to include the "Servo.h" library. After that, all that it takes to change the servo¬¥s angle is the following command. 

```ruby
servo.write(45);
```

### Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04) üìè
The main challenge in this category is to be able to turn corners and, consequently, avoid hitting walls. For this we used Ultrasonic Sensors; these are devices that measure the distance between itself and an object by emitting ultrasonic sound waves, which then convert the reflected sound into an electrical signal. To obtain said electrical signal and interpret it in centimeters we use the following code:

```ruby
long DisCalc(int TP, int EP) {

  digitalWrite(TP, LOW);                    // CLEAR THE TRIG PIN //
  delayMicroseconds(2); 

  digitalWrite(TP, HIGH);                   // SET THE TRIG PIN HIGH FOR 10 MICROSECONDS //
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(TP, LOW);

  long duration = pulseIn(EP, HIGH);        // READ THE ECHO PIN AND CALCULATE THE DIRECTION //

  long distance = duration * 0.034 / 2;     // CALCULATE THE DISTANCE IN CENTIMETERS //

  return distance;
}
```
The variable "distance"
